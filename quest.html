	  	<h1 id="first">Why MEST?</h1>
	  	<p>The reasons why I am at MEST have evolved since I first applied. Initially, all I wanted was to grow my skills as a programmer with the aim of starting a software company that will thrive. I still want this, only that the scope of my vision has grown since I did my MEST test and the subsequent interview. This is because I learnt that MEST doesn't just invest in ideas or skill, but people. You have to have the best attitude and character. That is why I want to join MEST to grow as a person wholesomely as I concouer the world that is software development</p>
  		
  		<h1>Growth points</h1>
  		<p>At MEST, I need to learn programming, business and communication, which is really everything they teach here. Coming from an engineering background has given me great experience with analytical and crytical thinking skills which I hope to use as I enter a new phase of my life. I also aim to improve my time management, which is very poor by the standards I hold my self to.</p>

	  	<h1 id="second">Why entrepreneurship?</h1>
	  	<p>Freedom is my biggest motivation to become a successful entrepreneur. I may be free to choose to do what I want when I want, but I am still a victim of consequence. There are also many things I would like to do before I leave this world but everything needs money, and that is one thing I lack. I have also lost people, and seen those around me lose family and friends all because we couldn’t afford treatment at the ‘best’ hospitals. All these things put me in an abstract cage that I refuse to live in, and therefore leads me to plot my way out of it through the road to successful business.</p>

	  	<h1>Goals</h1>
	  	<p>My goal is to get all the skills I need to be successful in the software industry and build a team, get funding, and run a successful business. Key word, success. I am here to succeed.</p>
